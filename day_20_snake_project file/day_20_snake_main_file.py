"""In your original code, you were checking for collisions between the snake's head and its body segments starting 
from the second segment onward (snake.segments[1:]). This can cause an issue because:

Initial Proximity:
            At the start of the game, the snake's body segments are very close to each other.

Immediate Collision Detection: As soon as the game starts, the snake moves, and the head's distance from its body 
segments can be very small,potentially triggering a false positive collision detection.

" Why Checking from the Fourth Segment Works " : By checking for collisions starting from the fourth segment (
snake.segments[3:]), you effectively skip the first few segments. Hereâ€™s why this helps:

Initial Movement Phase: During the initial phase of the game, the snake is still small, and the first few segments 
are too close to detect a real collision. By skipping these segments, you avoid false positives.

Sufficient Growth Time: The snake needs some time to grow and move away from its initial tightly-packed 
configuration. Starting from the fourth segment gives it that time."""
